## Holberton School Airbnb Clone - Command Interpreter 

### 

This is the first of a multipart project working towards building a full web application clone of AirBnb. In this first part, the Python programming language is used to build a command interpreter for the clone's web app. This command interpreter is similar to a BASH shell but it is designed for a specific use case of managing objects related to this project. The following projects will incorporate additional sections like HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API and front-end integration.

The console can excute the following functions:
-   Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
-   Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc
-   Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc)
-   Update attributes of an object
-   Destroy an object
